Implemented Project Student : Frontend ---> Backend ( working ) ----> Backend -> ( DB is not working : Logging is also not happening )

Why logging on apache is not happending.


In monolithic, you're dependent on the selected technology and you app can talk to one DB....

But in micro-services, each and every feature of the application can be developed by using different technology and each and every component can talk to the DB of it's choice.

Centos7 vs Centos8  :  yum vs dnf  ( on centos8, a new upgraded package manager DNF is there )

Sequel vs No-Sequel Database ?
