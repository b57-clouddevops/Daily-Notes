```
    No! AMI's offered in AWS are bare, basic & minimum.
    So, it's always recommended you patch/update them with all the patches and then customise it as per your requirement and publish them.
    Typically it would be a PRIVATE AMI, that means this AMI is not visible outside the account.

### Points to be notes when learning Linux :

```
    1) Linux is case-sensitive ( DevOps & devOps are different ) 
    2) In linux, there is no concept of file-extensions  ( file.txt is a filename including .txt )
    3) Everything is a file ( all the properties are values that we define in a file )
    4) There is no undo option, so ensure you take backup of the files when updating any values
    5) Everything do over CLI or Commands only
