### When do you get a merge conflict ?

```
    If we have checkout a branch from main say feature-001 and we have updated a file called as server.js ( a=10 ---> 30 ) and we are ready to push.
        Meantime, even before that someone has updated the value to a=10----> 25 and pushes to main. Not git will be confused.
